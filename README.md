# lifx-configurator

lifx-configurator generates a packet that can be sent to any Lifx bulbs on the local network to control their functions. 

Currently, only changing the brightness of the bulbs is allowed (I have only a plain bulb to use). If you have a colored bulb, it will change the color to green. Changes pending in the future.

# Build Instructions

1. run `cmake . && make`

# Using the application 

    Currently the best approach is to use the `control-lifx` bash file. In the future, `lifx-configurator` will contain that functionality.

    Edit the IP address in `control-lifx` to the desired bulb's address. Run `control-lifx` with the desired brightness to change bulb's brightness
